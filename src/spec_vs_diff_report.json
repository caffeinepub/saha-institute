  "summary": "Diff focuses on frontend routing and data-fetching pages (Centres/Announcements/Mock Tests) using TanStack Router + React Query and a useActor hook, plus adds hidden/easter-egg routes. There is not enough evidence in the diff summary of deployment/config fixes (dfx/canister config/build pipeline) or of a verified frontend-to-backend canister ID/agent initialization fix required to guarantee successful IC deployment.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-46",
      "requirement": "Investigate the current deployment failure and apply the necessary code/configuration fixes so the project deploys successfully to the Internet Computer (fresh build succeeds; `dfx deploy` succeeds; SPA routes render without unexpected Not Found).",
      "reason": "The diff summary only shows frontend route definitions and page-level loading/query behavior. It provides no evidence of deployment-related configuration changes (e.g., dfx.json, canister build setup, asset canister settings, SPA fallback for IC asset canister) or backend build/deploy fixes needed to ensure `dfx deploy` completes successfully.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-47",
      "requirement": "Ensure the deployed frontend correctly connects to the deployed backend canister (actor) so pages can fetch data without runtime errors (no blocking console errors; canister ID resolution works; Centres/Announcements/Mock Tests load empty/loading states or content).",
      "reason": "Pages were updated to gate queries on `actor` availability, but the diff summary does not show changes to the actor/agent initialization itself (e.g., canister ID resolution in production, environment variables, generated declarations usage, or useActor implementation). Without those, correct connection to the deployed backend canister cannot be confirmed.",
